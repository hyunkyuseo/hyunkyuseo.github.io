					<strong>IBM Design</strong> is one of the newest and widely growing organizations within IBM. Integrating methods such as design thinking, user-centric design, and user research, we focus on creating great experiences for our users. As part of the first 60 hires in 2013, I have witnessed the immense growth and effect of the organization reflected on IBM.

					At IBM Design I help designers understand complex cyber-security problems from the perspective of a protective security analyst, a malicious adversarial hacker, and an overseeing Chief Information Security Officer. On the other side of the spectrum, I help engineers understand design related user problems in context of their realm. This enables the designers and myself to be able to design the best experiences we can for the analyst and officer, and simultaneously protect users from the hacker. Some of the projects I have worked on include (but are not limited to): Software Accessibility Solutions, Software Patent/Inventions, Cloud Security, IBM X-Force Exchange, IBM AppScan family of products, and IBM Bluemix Single-Sign-On. Combining the domain knowledge, I collaborate with other designers to create the best user experience design, while also influencing the development team to push their efforts even further.

					Other than my primary role as a designer and technologist, I contribute to many side projects across IBM and the IBM Design Studio. Some side projects include: open source contributions, software accessibility designs and engineering, and contributions to IBM's patent and intellectual property portfolio.

					<strong>Cyber-security</strong> in general is one of the hardest problems to solve; apart from reaching a perfect balance of theoretical protection and business risk, it inherits the complexity of software in general. In addition to the natural complexities of software, cyber-security carries the burden of providing a good experience to a multitude of persons while defending the user from wild-card adversaries. I truly enjoy doing what I can to keep people and businesses safe, solving cyber-security obstacles and designing with users in mind.
