				<h1>Concept</h1>
				<p> 
					<strong>Atlas (2013)</strong> is composed of a
					series of various sized screens, where a number of invited participants upload images
					(of their work or of any image that inspires them at that moment, or that day, or that
					week…) during the course of the exhibition From here to there by means of a website
					portal. Akin to the painter Gehard Richter's image collection, Atlas, described as
					an "'organism' that continues to evolve and change,"(Helmut Friesel, Gerhard Richter:
					Atlas, introduction) Shoplifters of the World Unite and Take Over mutates and shifts too
					in both context and content over time. The physical piece was exhibited in the Stedman's Gallery at Camden, NJ.

					Images will be transferred to the various screen
					sizes in real time. During the duration of the exhibition, the images will continually
					change; ephemeral in nature, audiences will never be able to apprehend the expanse of
					the work, until or unless documented in printed form, itself an impossible proposition.
					The nature of the work itself become a commentary about the transitory nature of
					electronic media in particular and about art itself, in general. Atlas (2013) or Shoplifters
					of the World Unite and Take Over (2013) challenges the notions of aura, ephemerality
					and value—that Walter Benjamin had circumscribed in his seminal essay “Art in the
					Age of Mechanical Reproduction”—that we give to art and ideas in the age of electronic
					media. All images will be collected as documentation. By appropriating the images,
					gdloft—a design studio that serves non profit and art institutions —hopes to acquire the
					contributors' "perspective" and perception of the world, art, the self, etc.

				<h1>Collaboration</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>Contributors</strong> range from international recognized artists to everyday people. As graphic
					designers, much of gdloft's inspiration comes from everyday people and interaction.
					The many contributors were chosen based on their works, writings or persona, and
					their influence on gdloft's own artistic process. Many of the contributors are artists and
					everyday people who challenge the traditional notions of design in use or have a different
					process and strategy for getting through life and have become personal inspirations for
					the gdloft artists. Espiritu and Seo were interested in expressing this "influence" from
					the micro to the macro level, from Andrew Santos, a 33 year old who quit his job to
					care for a terminally ill mother, to Min + Sulki, an internationally renown design studio
					based in Seoul, who are influencing new perspectives of graphic design in Korea. Other
					participants include( and not limited to): Jonty Valentine (Aukland, NZ) is a leading
					designer and critic in New Zealand melding fine arts and graphic design; Ken Kim
					(Oakland, CA) is a designer at Apple by day, and creates experimental, architecture
					inspired art works by night; Ahree Lee (Los Angeles, CA) is a video artist, experimenting
					in issues of time; Rebbeca Gimenez (Chicago, IL) was recently art director of the
					Whitney Museum and is part of the experimental design group, We are Photoshop;
					Juliette Cezzar (NYC) is a designer, educator and author based in New York City
					whose work is anchored in book design; Sang Do Kim is a poet/ designer based in
					Korea; Christopher Gianunzio (Philadelphia, PA) is a award winning photographer
					and curator whose photography mixes graphic design pedagogy; Kevin Kernan, is a
					designer/silkscreen artist inspired by anime and monster culture and Christopher
					Espiritu (Newark, NJ) is the brother of the artist and a practicing graphic designer in
					NYC whose professional track was inspired by his older brother.
					Gdloft's act of curating a group of people and artists addresses the theme of
					inspiration and influence, on the one hand, and of using the electronic screen as a
					continuously changing reflection on the world of images, always in transition, becoming
					transient, and both meaningful and meaningless.
