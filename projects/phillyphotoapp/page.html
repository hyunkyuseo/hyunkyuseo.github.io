				<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> A long time partner of GDloft PHL, Philadephia Photo Arts Center (PPAC) runs an annual photo event where anyone can take a photo with any equipment and submit it to the organization. For submissions the hosting organization gathers a panel of photographers to judge the photographs. The chosen photographs will be shown all over the city of Philadelphia, in places like billboards, buses, and other public placements.</p>

				<h1>Project</h1>
				<p>
					For previous runs of Philly Photo Day the organization's method of processing a photograph was extremely manual; it involved people submitting a photograph over email, which was slow and unreliable to begin with, and processing them with inappropriate tools. The release of a newer iOS version allowed files to be uploaded on a web application. GDloft and I decided to take advantage of this launch and create a fully automated back-end system and web application photo processor for the Philadelphia Photo Arts Center to be used in Philly Photo Day. The web application is aimed for the general public, so the design and interaction patterns had to be dead simple.

				<h1>Process</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>WEB APPLICATION</strong> made the most sense in terms of reaching out to people relatively quickly regardless of device platform. By creating a web application, the fee and screening process of the App Store and Google Play Store were gone as well. The primary targets of the web application were iPhone and Android users, but the software also needed to accommodate for desktop uploads of people using traditional cameras and DSLR's.

					The web application was a custom application that is written with HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, PHP and MySQL. The web application allows the user to take a photograph or choose a photo from the mobile device's library. The upload is processed after the user fills out the submission information, and when the upload is complete, the user is provided with an email of his or her success. The staff of PPAC receives a photo in their FTP server with a file name system they have designated. At any point during the event, the staff of PPAC can download the submissions in multiple ZIP files, or view them in an online gallery.
