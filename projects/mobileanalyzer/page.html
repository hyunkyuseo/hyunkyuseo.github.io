				<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> IBM AppScan Mobile Analyzer is a tool aimed for mobile application  developers to scan their applications for security vulnerabilities. For the initial release, AppScan Mobile Analyzer provides a PDF report of the detected vulnerabilities from the scanned application.</p>

				<h1>Problem</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>EVERYDAY</strong> a plethora of security vulnerabilities are discovered for various platforms. It is normal to have an average of over 100 security issues, whether new or old, even in a relatively small and simple application. In order to contain this insanity, AppScan Mobile Analyzer helps prioritize and fix the security issues by providing a thorough audit and report of their software.

							<p>As AppScan Mobile Analyzer is part of IBM Bluemix, which is a platform as a Service product (PAAS) aimed at small businesses to create applications. AppScan Mobile Analyzer targets iOS, Android, and mobile web developers. Regardless of the developer's knowledge of cyber security, AppScan Mobile Analyzer acts as a security analyst for the company.

					Unlike all other AppScan products, AppScan Mobile Analyzer's goal is to deliver a security audit of an application to developers so they could then alleviate the security issues. It is an augmentation tool for developers to help create secure applications. The flow of the upload procedure had to be straight forward and guided. The user must be able to upload an application, feed it to AppScan Mobile Analyzer, and be provided with results.
				</p>
				<ol>
						<li>1. Choose type of platform to scan; Android, iOS or web</li>
						<li>2. Upload the application or point to a URL</li>
						<li>3. Wait for scan to complete</li>
						<li>4. Receive the audit</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
					The second step of uploading an application for Android and iOS was complicated because of the product being a cloud service. Clients did not want to upload their source code online. The design and technology had to accommodate for an intermediary step where the user has to convert their code into a binary format that only AppScan Mobile Analyzer can understand. There are two paths for timing of the scan that the user can choose after uploading: wait for AppScan to complete scanning, or choose to be alerted by an email of the product. After the scan, the user can access the report by navigating to the product's page under “Scan Results”.

				<h1>Process</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>CONSULTANCY</strong> is the style of approach that was taken in collaborating with the AppScan Mobile Analyzer team. At IBM Design there is a framework that designers follow called "IBM Design Thinking". Every product team is expected to follow such guidelines, however, this product was considered an exception because it was part of a pro bono side project for the team that was picked up by the design manager. Rather than the using IBM Design Thinking, a more aggressive and faster-pace style of a design agency was used instead. Although the project was finished in a relatively short period of time, because of the lack of design thinking and abrupt insertion of the design team, there were some core experience issues that ultimately we could not solve.
