				<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> One of the biggest designer organizations, AIGA holds a chapter Philadelphia and every year they hold a design competition that is judged by senior design practitioners. The Mighty Engine firm was a design agency where I worked at the time that helped host and design the annual event theme.</p>

				<h1>Project</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>2012</strong> was a year when there were about two-thousand and twelve guesses on how the world might end that year. Running with the theme of "end of the world", designers at The Mighty Engine agency and I had worked on a pop-culture spin-off modifying the phrase: "The revolution will be televised" to "The revolution will be designed".

					Rendering the print design involved integrating skeumorphic and grunge styles of CRT tube TV's as the frame of the canvas and supporting it with late 80's electronics illustrations. The website's primary function was to provide information about the design awards and process the submissions themselves. The interaction of the website featured a contrasting flat design that was inspired by the menu and controls of a CRT Monitor control interface. The webpages themselves were designed and laid out to resemble a network broadcast testing screen. An overlay of random static was added to the background along with some transitional animations to provide a fluid navigation experience.

							<p>The target demographic that submits to the design awards is relatively tech-savvy and adaptable to new technology. With the profile of the demographic, experimental designs were tried out. Given the demographic's ability to use technology, we decided to use PayPal as the sole payment processing system. Ease of integration and low cost of setup while keeping a good user experience was a huge benefit for AIGA Philadelphia and The Mighty Engine.

					Along with the pop culture references and experimental designs to attract the intended demographic, the actual process of submitting the work and paying for the submission had to be made fluid as well. Technologies like AJAX were heavily used in correlation with PHP and MySQL to limit the amount of pages for the user.

				<h1>Process</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>My first setback</strong> was also from this project.  While I was developing the front-end portion of this project, I realized how many little pieces and details I was leaving out. I couldn't include alt tags in images, code clean up, and coding with modularity in mind. I only realized that I made mistakes because the lead developer at the agency embarrassingly called me out.  Still, it was one of the most valuable moments I could have had as a designer and developer; it was a very humbling moment. This caused me to learn front-end coding, back-end coding, architecture and engineering on a deeper level, and how to integrate everything into the working code of the project itself as well those to come.
					<br />
					<span class="tab-space"></span>
					Although there were some launch problems (browser compatibility for one), after few fixes almost all of the submissions were processed successfully. The integration between front-end code, back-end code and then the ever-building database of submissions working together was quite a sight and a huge learning point. Like every designer and creative person, when I looked at the behaviors of the code I only saw opportunities to optimize and create cleaner and faster code.
