				<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> The design theme for AIGA Philadelphia chapter's office was called SPACE. The main theme was a large collection of logos created by GDloft and other designers in vinyl applied on the windows of the SPACE. The AIGA Philadelphia chapter president wanted to apply all of the logos that were created in a digital and interactive way.</p>

				<h1>Project</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>CAPTURING</strong> the new vibrant energy was the main concept for the interactive design. Since the physical space was new and the content within the SPACE was always changing, visitors were always filled with excitement. Utilizing motion capture and an interactive output allowed the project to absorb the excitement and give the energy back to the patrons.

				<h1>Process</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>MOTION</strong> was the main capture point of the interactive piece. Utilizing a webcam, a large TV, and a low powered computer, an image recognition and motion separation algorithm was made to capture the "excitement" of the room and display a randomly chosen logo (from the SPACE logo repository) at the screen. The logo continually changes and follows the pace of the physical activity in the building. In order to keep the pace of the logo shifting to a consumable level, the motion separation algorithm detects the average level of activities in the room and normalizes it.

					Along with the design of the software itself, the designers and I had to focus on the physical execution of this project because the project was being treated as an exhibition. Details that I never had to focus on before, such as the placement of monitor, camera, and concealing the equipment had to be considered when installing the piece. Since the nature of the software followed close to a kiosk, configuring the operating system installed on the host computer had to be modified extensively so it did not create any disturbances in the experience. These kind of details made me imagine beyond the software world when designing for a good software experience in future projects.
