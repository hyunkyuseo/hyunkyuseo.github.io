				<h2>2012-13 â€” Recreational :: Design Student at Rutgers University</h2>
				<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> The graphic design program that I have been a part of at Rutgers University has always pushed critical thinking and encouraged creating concepts. The production of design was an assumed responsibility of the student. Apart from some exercises, almost all assignments were open ended in terms of media and execution, while the concepts had a theme and focus. This kind of education model effectively brought out expressive and personal ideas from people. The photographs below are a brief snapshot of my projects from school.</p>
