				<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> Software security vulnerabilities have always been documented in separate websites that specialize in a particular platform or vulnerability. IBM Security X-Force Exchange is a product designed for security analysts to monitor cyber attacks in near real time, report on software security vulnerabilities, and collaborate to discover, fix, and research issues with others.</p>

				<h1>Problem</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>NOMAD</strong> is the word that comes to mind for all the security resource websites. A lot of resources specialize in a specific set of vulnerabilities, focusing on particular use cases on how the vulnerability could be used; this results in an inadequate context for the security analyst to grasp how the vulnerability could be applied to their organization. The job responsibilities of our users requires gathering as much information as possible regarding cyber security threats that could cause harm to their company.

							<h1>Security Analyst</h1>
							<h2>Late 20's to 30's</h2>
							<p>Working in a larger company this user is in charge of gathering new threats as well as researching documented threats that are relevant to their organization. They research using websites as well as a suite of other security tools.

							<h1>Chief Information Security Officer</h1>
							<h2>Mid 40's to 60's</h2>
							<p>
							The CISO is responsible for the general information flow of the company. The CISO is generally in charge of network security, employee device security, as well as infrastructure security. The user would spend little time on a specific security problem, as this user is more focused on the general security status of the company.

				<p>
					A community-based, threat-intelligence system can bring many advantages to the table compared to separate resources. When working in a community, one may bring insight to each software vulnerability using collaboration as a tool itself in order to surface more attack vectors. With additional insight and information, such discussions have a possibility of surfacing additional vulnerabilities and zero-day attacks.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>1. Research on trending threats</li>
					<li>2. Collaborate and contribute</li>
					<li>3. Repeat</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					A pretty basic but widely used research method is expected from the users of X-Force who wish to collaborate on security issues.

				<h1>Process</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>THE STRUGGLE:</strong> During the design and development production phase the original designs and prototypes were followed by the development teams, however, a lot of minor details were left out in the final production code. Upon initial release some animations and specific micro interactions were left out. The design team has worked extensively with the development team (located both overseas and intrastate) to implement the correct designs in the product, by providing more specific examples and code.

					At IBM it is widely known that the development team loves to use Java wherever they can. With this product team however, newer technologies like Angular, NodeJS, and NoSQL were used to create the product. The design team quickly became an advocate of using X-Force Exchange as a role model for writing new code and using new technologies.
