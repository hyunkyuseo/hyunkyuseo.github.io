				<p><strong>CONCEPT:</strong> Mixing typography layouts and a simple illustration, I wanted to create a poster that closely reflects an "ancient artifact" type.   Its purpose would be to educate other StarCraft 2 players who might come across such cheesy strategy being used against them. It can be utilized as a defensive or offensive guide. I decided that it would be nice to integrate at least a bit of Korean into the work; Hangul and Hanja seemed appropriate, because the creator of this strategy was Korean and it is still heavily used as a tactic in the Korean StarCraft 2 Servers. </p>
