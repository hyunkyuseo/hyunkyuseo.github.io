				<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> Previously featured in Fortune Korea Magazine, and Forbes Korea Magazine as the top CEOs of South Korea, Bryan Kim contacted me to to work with him on a new project he had in mind. We were to create a new brand and strategy for his new company, Transcure Bio Ventures, which is a venture capitalist firm focused in bio-medical engineering.</p>

				<h1>Challenge</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>RESEARCHING CANCER MEDICINE</strong> and being paid for it is the dream job for any enthusiastic group of engineers. Connecting with this company was one of the ways to obtain that job. The company needed to appear friendly, yet also have a firm stance on the founding principles. The word "sterile" came to mind in terms of not only design, but the process of synthesizing the chemicals for medicine. With the color blue synonymous with words like "serene" and "comfort", it was the natural accent color for the brand. The accent colors were used in the edges of business papers, and visual cues in the brand.

					Typography played a strong role in the design as the overall visual style being “sterile”. The visual effect of the typeface chosen needed to have a concrete presence on the header.  In contrast, the accommodating body type needed to have a more friendly-looking typeface with smoother angles and less sharp edges. Illustrations plays a complementary role as typography is the main visual focus of the design.

							<h1>Medical/Pharma Engineers and Researchers</h1>
							<h2>Mid 20's to Early 40's</h2>
							<p>
								The main target audience of this website are “the brainiacs” who have the knowledge, intelligence, and the concepts to work on medicine. Yet, they might not have the most technical expertise or even the best communication skills. It is important to have a monolithic presence as a brand but have a friendly and welcoming approach to people who are looking for funders.

							<h1>Venture Capitalists</h1>
							<h2>Late 40's to Mid 60's</h2>
							<p>
								A secondary target which has a similar technical skill to the primary target are other venture capitalists. They are primarily targeted to team up and cooperate to create a larger fund. Their primary purpose is to create a conversation with Transcure Bio Ventures, just like the engineers and researchers.

				<p>
					The users that we decided to focus on are not business people who market the idea (vaccines, medicine, etc) but brilliant researchers, students, and engineers who can present a proof of concept and perhaps a prototype. It is targeted to them as an enabling platform for people who want to contribute to the medical and pharmaceutical industry.

				<h1>Process</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>DESIGN THINKING AND PROCESS</strong> was fortunately part of the foundation of the company. It applied to creating strategies that appeal to people as well as the actual branding. The focus of the company collateral had to appeal to non-technical professionals, so it had to have an easy-to-use website and straight forward content. The digital content had to be available in the three popular platforms: smart-phones, tablets and desktops. The founders of the company believed that wide availability and a simple design on the stationary and website was needed to attract the most wide variety of audiences and to start a conversation.
					<br />
					<span class="tab-space"></span>
					Development focused on design, which allowed freedom of any way of execution and development. Utilizing HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, AJAX and some PHP, the webpage was created and tested for the three aforementioned platforms: phones, tablets, and desktops.
