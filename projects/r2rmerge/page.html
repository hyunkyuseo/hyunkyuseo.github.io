				<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> In late 2012, the Camden campus of Rutgers University where I studied graphic design came under fire. Seemingly out of the blue, Chris Christie, the Governor of New Jersey, endorsed a plan to overhaul the higher-education system in New Jersey. Part of the disclosure called for my school to be divorced from the Rutgers family and merge it to Rowan University. Worse yet, the Governor's plan was utterly lacking in detail. Students, their parents, and alumni did not have much awareness of this plan, so I decided to start a campaign against it.

				<h1>Problem</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>CORRUPTION AND CAMDEN</strong> seem to accompany each other frequently when the city is mentioned in the media. At the break of the merger plan, it wasn't any different. The campus was just part of an elaborate plan involving both private investors such as George Norcross of Cooper Health Systems and New Jersey representatives including Senator Sweeney (D), Donald Norcross (D; Brother of George Norcross) to create an artificial state education funding pipeline by absorbing local property. Upon discovering the plan, I decided to create a website that allowed people to sign a petition against the plan.

							<h1>Student Body</h1>
							<h2>Early 20's to Mid 30's</h2>
							<p>Although students might be passionate, they are a rather tough demographic to target. They are often busy with studies and tend to be easily distracted. The student body—being the main audience—influneced the creation of the core design. The design was to use recognizable typefaces such as "Gotham" (as they have probably seen it during the Obama campaign) and use bold colors.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h1>Alumni, Faculty, and NJ Residents</h1>
							<h2>Ranging from 40's to 60's</h2>
							<p>The second type of demographic targeted mostly the alumni, faculty, and residents of New Jersey. The older crowd usually seemed to look more for information and would take action when pushed. The website's information architecture was created in such a way that any link could lead a user to help the organization.

					The idea of the website was to bring everyone up to speed on the plan and allow them to take action. Along with the primary purpose of signing an online petition against the proposed plan and possible legislation, the R2RMerge website provided tools like targeted template emails, VOIP phone calls, representative meeting broadcasts, and general information regarding the proposal. Later the website turned into an organization with a vast network of alumni and professors, which enabled physical outreach and activism.

				<h1>Outcome</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>"WE DID IT."</strong> was the last message I sent out to the 14,000+ people who have participated in the movement. After months of hard work from the Rutgers Board of Governors and Trustees, politicians, students, parents, alumni, faculty and many others, the Senate, No. 2063 State of New Jersey 215th Legislature was signed and the campus of Rutgers Camden was prevented from merging with Rowan University. *Current news of UMDNJ merger with Rutgers University is a different news and has been in the planning for awhile.
