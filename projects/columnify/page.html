				<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> At the time of the plug-in, it was difficult for me to create a left-to-right and top-to-bottom, stacking card design that looked similar to Pinterest. I had to use this design pattern during the process of creating the <a href="#/projects/wpac">Wolf Performing Arts Center</a> project. Rather than using the code once, I decided to release it so others can save some time.</p>

				<h1>Problem</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>CARDS</strong> and their model of stacking left to right and top to bottom can be a tricky thing to develop. It is because the box model of CSS always follows a baseline of the lengthiest card on the row before the one being rendered. At the time, there were other plug-ins that helped to create a card-stack system, but all followed a collapsible system where the cards did not stack in a reading order (left to right and top to bottom).

				<h1>Process</h1>
				<p>
					The code was created with jQuery (a JavaScript library) in order to keep length and size of the plug-in code to a minimum. The plug-in required only one parameter, which was the value of the cards that were going to be displayed in a row. The plug-in calculates each height of the cards and calculates a margin offset per card that aligns all of the cards left to right.
